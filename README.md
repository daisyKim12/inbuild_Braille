# Inbuild Braille SideWalk Block for visually impaired
This poject is to make a shoe that can help visually impaired navigate with ease. Using camera and AI road following model indicator built inside a shoe will guild a person to a safe route. And ultrasonic sensor will warn the user if there are any obstical infront. We used arduino as a controller to be the edge device to controll any input and output data by user. Arduino will connect remotely with a PC to process road following AI model.
